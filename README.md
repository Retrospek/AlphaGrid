### AlphaGrid

Each project builds upon the last — designed to take you from foundational reinforcement learning in finance to cutting-edge research topics and real-world complexity.

### 🪙 1. **Risk-Aware RL Trading Agent** _(Foundations)_

- Learn the basics of RL-based trading with proper risk management.
- Integrate Value-at-Risk (VaR), stop-losses, or Sharpe-optimized rewards.
- Teaches: Action spaces, reward shaping, episodic training, evaluation metrics.

---

### 📈 2. **News-Aware RL Agent**

- Add context to market data with NLP-driven sentiment from headlines.
- Use transformer-based embeddings or FinBERT to inject market narrative.
- Teaches: Feature engineering, environment design with multi-modal inputs.

---

### 🔁 3. **Meta-RL for Regime Switching**

- Detect and adapt to changing market regimes (bull/bear/sideways).
- Train a meta-agent to pick the best sub-strategy per regime.
- Teaches: Multi-policy selection, LSTM/context-encoder use, online adaptation.

---

### 💹 4. **Cross-Market Arbitrage Agent**

- Exploit pricing inefficiencies between correlated assets (e.g., BTC/ETH, ETFs).
- Trade asset pairs using correlation dynamics and time-lagged signals.
- Teaches: Correlation modeling, simultaneous action spaces, market-neutral strategy learning.

---

### ⚡ 5. **High-Frequency RL in Limit Order Books (LOB)**

- Simulate an o

rder book and train an agent to place/modify/cancel orders.

- Compete with synthetic or historical market participants.
- Teaches: High-frequency data handling, fine-grained action timing, delayed reward resolution.

---

### 🧠 6. **Multi-Agent Portfolio Management**

- Assign each agent a different asset class and optimize global capital allocation.
- Explore agent collaboration, reward redistribution, and capital flow logic.
- Teaches: Multi-agent systems, resource allocation, shared vs individual objectives.

---

### 🧠 7. **Options Strategy Optimization**

- RL agents that build and manage option combinations (spreads, straddles).
- Reward shaped with Greek sensitivities (delta, gamma, theta).
- Teaches: Nonlinear payoffs, hedging, constrained action spaces, exotic reward surfaces.

---

### 🧬 8. **Self-Adaptive Risk Manager**

- Build an agent that dynamically adjusts leverage, exposure, and capital risk levels based on live volatility metrics.
- Reward shaped by drawdown avoidance and volatility-scaling techniques.
- Teaches: Dynamic policy conditioning, adaptive agent behavior, continual learning.

---

### 🧬 9. **Inverse Reinforcement Learning on Market Behavior**

- Apply IRL to deduce hidden strategies from trader activity or price movement.
- Extract learned reward functions from observable market dynamics.
- Teaches: Apprenticeship learning, max entropy IRL, behavioral inference.

---

### 🧪 10. **GAN + RL for Market Simulation (Sim2Real)**

- Use GANs to synthesize realistic market environments.
- Train agents in simulation, then fine-tune on real data for deployment.
- Teaches: Model-based RL, sim2real adaptation, adversarial training, robustness.
